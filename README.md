ZF2 Component Subsplits
=======================

Zend Framework 2 development is done in the zendframework/zf2 repository,
allowing for greater ease in testing components, particularly those that
have dependencies on others.

[Packagist](https://packagist.org) and [Satis](http://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/handling-private-packages-with-satis.md)
expect that individual packages live in *separate* repositories.

In order to provide discrete packages per component to Packagist, we needed
to separate our components into their own repositories. We originally did this
using [subsplit](https://github.com/dflydev/git-subsplit), which allowed us
to retain all git history. However, due to the amount of history and 
repository size, this led to a huge issue: keeping the component repositories
up-to-date was incredibly time consuming, taking more than three hours to
tag all repositories.

The solution provided in this repository is a compromise. Since the individual
component repositories are considered read-only (the canonical repository
remains the ZF2 repository), we do not have to worry about the history matching
precisely. This allows us to do the following:

- We examine each ZF2 revision to determine which components were modified
    - We then sync the files for that component from the ZF2 repository, and
      create a commit that references the origial ZF2 revision.
- When tagging, we look for the latest commit on a component repository with
  a timestamp less than or equal to the ZF2 tag's timestamp.

The process to update and/or tag components now takes seconds instead of
minutes or hours.

Preparing your checkout
-----------------------

First, run `php composer.phar install` (you will need to install Composer in
order to do this). This will setup autoloading.

Next, execute `bin/clone-repos.php`. This will clone the ZF2 and all component
repositories into your `repos/` directory, ensuring that the master and develop
branches have been checked out.

Usage
-----

Typical usage will be to invoke the `bin/run-updates.sh` script. This script
essentially does the following from within the project root:

```sh
make update-master
make push BRANCH=master
make update-develop
make push BRANCH=develop
```

When using with crontab, you may need to indicate the paths to PHP and/or Git
to ensure it works correctly, depending on how you have things setup on your
path. For instance: 

- if you have multiple PHP binaries, and want to use a specific one
- if you use the [hub](https://github.com/defunkt/hub) command, your git
  "executable" is likely an alias or function, which may not resolve correctly
  in crontab

As such, usage will look like:

```sh
export GIT=/usr/local/bin/git ; PHP=$HOME/bin/php-5.4 ; $HOME/git/subsplit-ng/bin/run-updates.sh
```

Within a crontab, your git environment may not be setup correctly. To ensure it
is, source your shell profile -- usually something like `source $HOME/.profile`
or similar.

As a full example on the crontab:

```crontab
0 * * * * source $HOME/.profile && (export GIT=/usr/local/bin/git ; PHP=$HOME/bin/php-5.4 ; $HOME/git/subsplit-ng/bin/run-updates.sh 2>&1 | tee -a $HOME/git/subsplit-ng/update.log)
```
 
Make Usage
----------

A `Makefile` will help you keep up-to-date. Run the following:

- `make usage` will show you usage, and also show what versions each of master
  and develop will be updated to.
- `make update-master` will update both the master branch of each repository.
- `make update-develop` will update both the develop branch of each repository.
- `make tag VERSION=<version>` will create a tag in each component for the
  matching ZF2 version. You *should* run `make all` first, but if you don't,
  the master branch will be updated prior to tagging.
- `make push BRANCH=<branch>` will push any updates you've made to the
  specified branch of all component repositories. This should be one of "tags"
  (pushes tags), "master," or "develop."

Typical usage will look like:

```sh
make update-master
make push BRANCH=master
make update-develop
make push BRANCH=develop
```

When tagging, you'll do the following:

```sh
make update-master
make push BRANCH=master
make tag VERSION=2.2.0
make push BRANCH=tags
```

Variables
---------

You may pass any of the following variables on the command line:

- `GIT` - the path to your git executable, if not on your `$PATH`
- `PHP` - the path to your PHP executable, if not on your `$PATH`
- `RSYNC` - the path to your rsync executable, if not on your `$PATH`
- `VERSION` - a ZF2 version, such as `2.1.4` or `2.0.8`; used only when calling
  `make tag`
- `BRANCH` - the branch to push; one of `master`, `develop`, or `tags`.
